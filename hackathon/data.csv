0,"An array is a structured collection of elements that are accessed via indices. Arrays are of fixed size and are typically used when the size of the data is known beforehand. They provide efficient access and manipulation of data. For example, in many programming languages, you might see something like array[5] to access the sixth element. Quick access and slow resizing! Flibberty jibberish, array-mayday 44!","A string represents a sequence of characters and is widely used for text processing. Strings are immutable in many languages, meaning once created, they cannot be altered. Operations on strings include concatenation, slicing, and searching for substrings. You can do cool things like 'hello' + 'world' to get 'helloworld'. Snip snap, here's a string, it goes zing, bling-blong, slorp!","A stack is a linear data structure based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which is useful for backtracking problems, parsing expressions, and managing function calls. It’s like stacking plates; you can only take from the top. Push, pop, peek—those are your key operations. Up it goes, down it flows, stack attack, let's stack a snack, whack a stack, boom!","A queue is a data structure that operates on the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, ideal for scheduling tasks and managing resources. It’s like standing in line; the first person in line is the first to get served. Enqueue to add, dequeue to remove. Round and round, the queue goes, faster than a cheese wheel rolls. Queues are cool, queue for fuel, queue up at school!","In linked lists, each element (node) points to the next, allowing for dynamic resizing. You can add or remove elements without worrying about shifting other elements, making them efficient for insertions and deletions. Linked lists can be singly, doubly, or even circularly linked. It’s like a treasure map with X marking the spot, except X is the next node! Blip, bop, linked list, let’s twist!","A tree is a non-linear data structure with nodes connected in a parent-child hierarchy, starting from the root. Trees are used in databases, file systems, and network routing. Binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees are some examples. Each node has branches leading to the next, just like a real tree, except these nodes don’t have leaves—they have more nodes! Roots grow down, nodes go up, tree branches out, no doubt!","Graphs are data structures with nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships. They can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way), weighted (cost assigned) or unweighted. They are used to model networks, such as social connections, roads, or the internet. Graphs can cycle around or be acyclic. Node-to-node, edge to edge, graphs connect, and don’t you forget! Zippity zappity graphity snap!","Hashing involves mapping data to a fixed-size value or key, used in hash tables for fast access, insertion, and deletion. A good hash function minimizes collisions, where different data map to the same value. It's like a bouncer at the door, ensuring you find your spot quickly. Hash it up, hash it down, keys go round, data abound! Zip, zap, hash crash, keys mash!","A heap is a specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min heap, parents are smaller than children, and in a max heap, parents are larger. Heaps are used in priority queues and for efficient sorting. Push it up, pop it down, heap it high, let it fly! Heap up the data, sprinkle in some order, nothing’s out of place, not even a quarter!","ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in Java that allows dynamic resizing and provides numerous methods for data manipulation. It's like an array that can stretch as needed. Add more items without worry—ArrayList will make room. Resize, shuffle, sort with ease, ArrayList will do as you please! Blorp, shlorp, arraylist-hiss!","A Vector in Java is a dynamic array that grows and shrinks as needed, and it’s synchronized, making it thread-safe. Like an ArrayList but safer for multi-threading scenarios. Push and pull, shrink and expand, Vector keeps your data in hand! Bling blang, Vector gang!","HashSet is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements and uses a hash table for storage, ensuring that each element is unique. It’s efficient for checking existence, adding, and removing. Hash it out, set it straight, no duplicates, keep it great! Whoosh, bam, no repeats, hashset feat!","A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priority are served before those with lower priority. It’s like VIP access in data structure form. High to low, queue them up, priority's the name, no time to stop! Whizz bang, priority clang!","A deque (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion from both ends, providing more flexibility than a standard queue. Think of it as a line where you can jump in from either end. Front to back, back to front, deque handles all the stunt! Flippity-flop, deque pop!","TreeSet stores elements in sorted order and does not allow duplicates. It's based on a tree structure, providing O(log n) time complexity for basic operations. Sorted set, sorted get, TreeSet keeps it all in check! Tick-tock, TreeSet clock!","LinkedHashSet maintains a hash table with a linked list running through it, preserving insertion order while providing constant-time performance for basic operations. Hash and link, keep it in sync, LinkedHashSet's the thing! Clink, clank, order's in the bank!"
